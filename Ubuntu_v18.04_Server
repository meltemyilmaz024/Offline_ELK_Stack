### Directory layout of RPM
The RPM places config files, logs, and the data directory in the appropriate locations for an RPM-based system:

Type      : home | Elasticsearch home directory or $ES_HOME
Location  : /usr/share/elasticsearch

Type      : bin : Binary scripts including elasticsearch to start a node and elasticsearch-plugin to install plugins
Location  : /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin

Type      : conf : Configuration files including elasticsearch.yml
Location  : /etc/elasticsearch | ES_PATH_CONF

Type      : conf : Environment variables including heap size, file descriptors.
Location  : /etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch

Type      : data : The location of the data files of each index / shard allocated on the node. Can hold multiple locations.
Location  : /var/lib/elasticsearch | path.data

Type      : logs : Log files location.
Location  : /var/log/elasticsearch | path.logs

Type      : plugins : Plugin files location. Each plugin will be contained in a subdirectory.
Location  : /usr/share/elasticsearch/plugins

Type      : repo : Shared file system repository locations. Can hold multiple locations. 
                  A file system repository can be placed in to any subdirectory of any directory specified here.
Location  : Not configured | path.repo

Configuring Elasticsearch

Config files location

Elasticsearch has three configuration files:

 * elasticsearch.yml for configuring Elasticsearch
 * jvm.options for configuring Elasticsearch JVM settings
 * log4j2.properties for configuring Elasticsearch logging
 
 For the archive distributions, the config directory location defaults to $ES_HOME/config. 
 The location of the config directory can be changed via the ES_PATH_CONF environment variable as follows:
    * ES_PATH_CONF=/path/to/my/config ./bin/elasticsearch
    
Config file format
The configuration format is YAML. Here is an example of changing the path of the data and logs directories:

  path:
      data: /var/lib/elasticsearch
      logs: /var/log/elasticsearch
      
 Environment variable substitution
    Environment variables referenced with the ${...} notation within the configuration file will be replaced with the value of the environment variable. 
    For example: 
      node.name:    ${HOSTNAME}
      network.host: ${ES_NETWORK_HOST}
      
 Promting for Settings
 
 For settings that you do not wish to store in the configuration file, you can use the value ${prompt.text} or ${prompt.secret} and start Elasticsearch in the foreground. 
 ${prompt.secret} has echoing disabled so that the value entered will not be shown in your terminal;
 ${prompt.text} will allow you to see the value as you type it in. For example:
 
 node:
  name: ${prompt.text}
  
 When starting Elasticsearch, you will be prompted to enter the actual value like so:

    Enter value for [node.name]:
    
  Values for environment variables must be simple strings.
    export HOSTNAME=â€œhost1,host2
   
  Cluster and node setting types
    Dynamic : You can configure and update dynamic settings on a running cluster using the cluster update settings API.
    Static  : Static settings can only be configured on an unstarted or shut down node using elasticsearch.yml.
    
    (*) Static settings must be set on every relevant node in the cluster.

    1. Disable swapping
      Disable all swap files : sudo swapoff -a
      (*) To disable it permanently, you will need to edit the /etc/fstab file and comment out any lines that contain the word swap.
    2. Increasefile descriptors
    3. Ensure sufficient virtual memory
    4. Ensure sufficient threads
    5. JVM DNS cache settings
    6. Temporary directory not mounted with noexec
